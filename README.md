# FAMILY TREE APPLICATION
  

Family Tree Application is a desktop application for adding family members in relationship and visualize them in a tree.  

## About The Project 

Hello, it is a Family Tree Application that we can manage our family information. Firstly, when we run our application, we have to create our family with the create new tree button. Then, click on the root person and edit the person information at the right side of the application. The user can save his/her information when he/she clicks on the save information button.

The user can also add relatives, thanks to the add relative button. So, when user clicks on the add relative button, user will see a new screen that contains relative inputs. At the combo box, the user can select relative type. Relative types are child, parent and spouse.  When he/she fills these inputs and clicks add relative button, relative information would be saved and added to the tree. That button will return the main screen of the application. Then, user can click on tree and see the relations of the relatives. The user can also click on relatives at the tree, and can add relatives to them.

Also, this application contains load and save buttons next to the create new tree button. Save tree saves the current tree at the application. Open tree opens the previous saved trees. At the top left, a menubar called File consists of new tree, open tree, save tree and exit menu items. When user clicks on new tree or create new tree an empty tree will be created. The application shall be used after reading the README documentation. 

This is an example of how the application works;
